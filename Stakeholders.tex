A critical stakeholder in this research would be the industry partner.

The take up of machine learning within industry has been been somewhat stymied by the misunderstanding that machine learning cannot appropriately be deployed within the workplace as the results, even when accurate, cannot be explained. The term “black box” is often used which itself would suggest some kind of magic. However the individual components used within the field of machine learning are very well understood and hence this description is inappropriate. It should thus be apparent that by validating this research for the benefit of our industry partner that any industry group thinking about deploying a machine learning project would themselves be valid stakeholders. 

The last stakeholder would be any researcher needing to make a prediction from closed-ended questionnaires.
