Broad research topic

\textit{Association Rule Mining}

\noindent
Currently we have a focused topic about my research

\textit{Association Rule Mining and Decision Making for Closed-Ended Hierarchical Questionnaire Data} 

\noindent
or maybe

\textit{Discovering Outlier Candidates Using Only their Closed-Ended Medical Questionnaire Data}


\noindent
We can turn this into a claim 

\textit{No one has used association rule mining to make decisions on closed-ended questionnaire data.}

\noindent
Developing a question

Some things to think about:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The history of your topic
	\item The structure and composition of your topic
	\item The categorisation of your topic
	\item Develop negative questionsâ€“Why has EIT not been carried out with RF fields?
	\item Develop speculative questions.
	\item Extend questions posed in the literature
\end{itemize}


\noindent
Why is this important? What's the reason for the research?

\textit{This is in order to help my reader understand how association rules can be used to  .....}

\noindent
Research statement

\textit{Consequence of my research is that candidates that would inevitably fail a medical assessment maybe excluded before the actual assessment.}

\textit{I am trying to study if it is possible to use association rule mining to draw conclusions on the medical readiness of a candidate for a certain position given only the information they provide from a closed questionnaire.}

\noindent
Thesis statement

\textit{Selecting a good job candidate that matches a role to progress to an actual medical is possible through association rule mining using only their closed health questionnaire responses.}

Alternative way of developing a thesis statement by using the topic and keywords, such as
