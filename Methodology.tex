Babbie (2015~\cite{babbie2015practice}) states that research is a \textit{"systematic and orderly approach taken towards the collection and analysis of data so that information can be obtained from those data"}
A research methodology establishes the framework for research, amongst other things it defines strategy, approach and components for the research. 

Methodologies can be categorised as either qualitative or quantitative and further broken down into approaches such as survey designs, case study, action research, constructivist grounded theory, bibliometric research, design science research, researching history, ethnographic research and experimental research (Williamson \& Johanson (2017~\cite{williamson2017research}). 

Over time certain methodologies have been put forward that suite the field of Information Systems which is the chosen field of this work. It is Design Study Research (DSR) which has been selected as the most suitable of these for this particular work. In DSR \textit{"researchers focus on building some kind of artefact they believe will be useful to a particular stakeholder community. They then evaluate the merits of the artefact in various ways"} (Williamson \& Johanson (2017~\cite{williamson2017research}). Figure \ref{fig:typesofresearch} shows the differences between the classic approach, which creates artefacts to attempt to build or test a theory and the DSR approach which builds artefacts that are useful to certain stakeholders.

Hevner et al. (2004~\cite{hevner2004design}) argued that DSR artefacts can take one of the four forms shown in Figure~\ref{fig:artefactforms}. This definition has not however gained widespread approval and other researchers have put forward differing claims to what defines a DSR approach. Authors such as Gregor and Jones (2007~\cite{gregor2007anatomy}) disagree with this principle and instead suggest a framework where design-research theory is paramount.

Indeed one of the issues of DSR is in proving any such research has indeed been done in a rigorous manner as no single approach has been adopted as the gold standard. The approaches that have been put forward include Hevner et al. (2004~\cite{hevner2004design}) which suggests a set of 7 non mandatory guidelines (Table~\ref{tab:HevnerGuidelines}) that should be "addressed in some manner for design-science research to be complete".

A number of concerns of this approach have been pointed out by academics, including its generic applicability to other types of research apart from DSR and the difficulty in gauging some of the guideline's aims. For instance what makes an artefact viable or how do we know when an artefact has been produced rigorously?

Gregor and Jones (2007~\cite{gregor2007anatomy}) does not suffer from this generic criticism. They put forward an approach which looks at design-science theory and states that design-science theory has 6 obligatory components and potentially a further 2 optional ones (Table~\ref{tab:GregorGuidelines}).

Again this approach has suffered criticism in giving only minimum guidance in the pursuit of research rigour. Another criticism is it only considers 'method' and 'product' artefacts from the 4 possibilities mentioned in Figure~\ref{fig:artefactforms} that defines DSR.

Peffers et al. (2007~\cite{peffers2007design}) suggest a research methodology using a six step process for correct implementation of DSR (Table~\ref{tab:PefferGuidelines}). Through these steps Peffers et al. claim they are able to confirm design-science research which is "valuable, rigorous, publishable". Others have made similar claims with many frameworks having some comparable ideas along with their own strengths and weaknesses. Many practitioners advise that you simply choose one that fits your research and then simply adhere to it rigorously.

Objectives that a researcher must conform to demonstrate well structured DSR should show clearly that they understand the problem at hand and not jump to a solution first approach. Do not create a 'solution looking for a problem'. In describing the problem they must specify who is experiencing the problem, what is the nature of the problem and success criteria. Why this problem can't be solved with existing means. When the problem arises, where it occurs and stakeholders affected by it. Through covering all these questions the researcher is explaining they understand the nature and boundary of the problem. The boundary of a problem is important as too narrow a scope would be considered uninteresting in the research community and too wide a scope, impractical.

Amongst the outcomes of this research will be the development of a number of novel algorithms to be incorporated into a commercial software product. It is the algorithms that are developed during the design phase that will satisfy the artifact requirement of DSR. The stakeholder community will initially involve the industry partner of the university but will ultimately be useful to anyone dealing with the problem of classifying the answers to closed survey/questionnaire data.
